'''Identifier'''

give Naming - variable, function, Clas , module

Function - It is independent in nature it is a ve.cuable block of code that performe a specific tark,

- function are defined using the def' keyword, followed by the function name and parameters in parentheses.

•Method Store in a class, depended in nature..

-It is similar to a function but is associate with an object

- Method care functions defined within a
class and operate on the data contained within that specific class instance..

• - Module is a file containing python code. (Scech as functions, clases that can be Python scripts and variables) imported and wed in other or modules

It help organize code and make it recusable programme across different part of a or multiple program

wed to • vorriable Store the data, chich can then be referenced and manipulated in the code contracce data variable is notoning. -Variables containers for storing values, such as members, String, lists Or more Complex Objects.

Class A class is a blueprint for creating object, which cere. Class instances of that A class operate data and behaviour (in the form of attributes and methods). that define the object's properties and autons.

- Classes are a fundamental part of Oop in python.

Inside the class, methods (functions coithin classes) define the behaviours, cand attributes define the of doject created Propentier from the Class.


'''Rules of Identifier'''

1)Case Sensitive(a ≠ A)

2) Use only 'lowercase', 'uppercase', 'digit 'and separate with ' , '

3)Not start with 'degit'
