'''Where to use Python------------------------'''


1)Web application Development - which work with the Desktop application Development - Download is on
 Operating System.

2) Desktop application Development - download and work on OS.
3) Database application Development - Small/big application develop
4) Desktop and web testing-each testing of performance
5) Date Analysis... both  very imp., prediction, analysis the situation
6) Data Science....GUI
7) Machine learning ....work as human, input manually

8) Deep Learning sencer learning

9) AI (Artificial Intelligence)

10) Neural Network - what amount data fetch in particular

11)IOT device (Internet Of things) broad band, wires, fibers


'''Limitation------------------------'''

1)Payment system of mobile application development
2) Banking payment system

..History of Python----------------------------

1991 Guido van Roussou invent python on feb 20
1989 he made merge -- perl + C++ = abc(giving new name)

Python is a POPs concept (procedure Oriented programming Syntax)

POPs opposite OOPs (Object Oriented Programing Syntax)



 • Language -----High level language (only know 0-1 binary)
                 Middle Level Language (know A-Z char)
                 High Level language (everything accept)





                                       '''OOPS & POPS-----------------------'''

 •OOPs Object Oriented Programing Syntax
        High Syntax (Clumgy)
        Secure

・POPS (procedure Oriented Programming Syntax)
        easy Syntax
        White like easy english syntax

.1991---version (0.1 & 0.2)
.1994 ---version 1 (cork from 1994-2000)

.2008 version 3
        bring 60k library & Change the syntax.

                                           '''Identifier----------'''

.give Naming - variable, function, Class , module

.Function - It is independent in nature. it is a reusable block of code that perform a specific task,
.function are defined using the 'def' keyword, followed by the function name and parameters in parentheses.

• Method--- Store in a class, depended in nature..
          -It is similar to a function but is associate with an object
          - Method care functions defined within a class and operate on the data contained within that
          specific class instance..


• - Module is a file containing python code. (Such as functions, classes  and variables that can be imported
and used in other Python scripts   or modules)
  - It help organize code and make it reusable  across different part of a programme or multiple program.


• variable -Store the data, which can then be referenced and manipulated in the code. without  data variable is
 nothing.
  -Variables act as containers for storing values, such as members, String, lists Or more Complex Objects.


. Class-- A class is a blueprint for creating object. which are instances of that class.  A class operate data
 and behaviour (in the form of attributes and methods). that define the object's properties and actions.
   - Classes are a fundamental part of Oop in python.
   - Inside the class, methods (functions within classes) define the behaviours, and attributes define the
Properties   of object created from the Class.


                               '''Rules of Identifier---------------'''

1)Case Sensitive(a ≠ A)

2) Use only 'lowercase', 'uppercase', 'digit' and separate with ' , '

3)Not start with 'degit'

.a=10
Print (a)            10

.a=10

aaHVUlad_12=10

HVUlabc= 10

_HUV = 90

                            '''Casing-------------'''

1-Camel Casing.
2-Snake Casing

1--- Camel Casing used in making folder, Class, module
---Use upper, lower and  digit
---ex =StateBankOfIndia1997

2----Snake Casing used in File , variable, function, module
----everything is lower
----State_bank_of_India_1997


                               '''feature of python--------'''
