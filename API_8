# APIs(application programming interface
'''..what is an APIs----api is a set of rules and protocol;ls that allow one software application to
 interact with another as well it will interact between the modules.
..it define how different s/w component should impact
..KEY CHARCTERSTICS OF APIs
1-communication--api allow applications to communicate and share data or functionality.
2-data exchange--apis often exchange data in formats like json(rest api) or xml (soap api ).
3..modularity--they unable modular development where different components can work independently but together.
4--paytm
5--social media api--facebook,meta
6--maps apis--google,safari


Types of APIs--------
rest api and soap api ,they are two type of approach
..soap api(simple object acess protocol)---soap api is a protocol based api that follows a strict standard
structure for message         and is typically used in environment requiring high security and reliability.
..use area ----user interface, document of standard company

..restapi---(representational state transfer api)---it is the dynamic  transfer of data between two module / application
it follow the principle of rest,and archetectual style that user standard HTTP(hyper text transfer procol) methods
(get.post,put,patch,delete)
for communication and focus on resource represent by URLs

keypoint of rest api==
stainlesness ==each request is independent ,its mean the server doesnot retain any cliient context between
the request.
source-based==the api structure around 'sources' such as , users field,produc field, accessable via soecific urls.
data format(use in json)
NOTE==restapi is flexible and lightweight ,its ideal for web and mobile app, simplicity and scalability
Archetector module==
MVC-model vies controller   --mvc is a design pattern that commonly use for developing the application specially
web application .
     a.user interaction in view
     b. view send input to contoler
     c.control  souces the imput
     d.  controles manupulate
     e.  model updaates
     model nodiffff view
     new updates the display

mvc steps request to rsponse
-user action on view(send the request)
-view send input to te contr
-controler process input amd manupulate a the data
  -model update the data and
  -view retrive  updaes data from the models an d upda the display from uses.-
  -view is responsible to access the used and send the respnse from nuser
 -NOTE--model= manage data and business logicc
 -view-manager  use interaction-controler-handles user input and interactinh logic

'''what is mean of dev framework ?'''
framework is a way its a process, its a archetecture some basic principle and the rules of developmental way.
 A development framework is a set of tools and libraries that provide a structured  foundation for building
s/w application.


'''what is flask'''
Flask is a light weight and open source web framework written in python .It's known as a micro framework
because it provide the basic tools to create web application without the  need of last dependencies and complex
configuration.

'''advantages'''
1..light weight and modular
2..build in the development server and debugger
3..restfull request handling
4..microservices compatibility
